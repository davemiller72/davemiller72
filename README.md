- 👋 Hi, I’m @davemiller72
- 👀 I’m interested in music (guitars and songwriting mainly)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin for Android
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: not sure yet. 

Following a computer science degree, I worked for 15 or so years as a software developer in various industries, including education, scientific instruments, business systems and proteomic analysis software. Mainly using c, C++, C# - the usual progression.
After that came 12 years in the medical devices industry looking after clinical samples, quality systems, regulatory stuff, etc. but I have always kept programming on the sidelines: HTML, PHP, CSS, REST apis, Arduino projects and so on.
Now I am looking to come full circle and hit programming again - probably in the mobile domain, hence learning Kotlin.
