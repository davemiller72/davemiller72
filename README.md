- 👋 Hi, I’m Dave
- 👀 I’m interested in music (guitars and songwriting mainly)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Dart/Flutter anf React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: not sure yet. 

<p>Following a computer science degree, I worked for 15 or so years as a software developer in various industries, including education, scientific instruments, business systems and proteomic analysis software. Mainly using c, C++, C# - the usual progression.</p>
<p>After that came 12 years in the medical devices industry looking after clinical samples, quality systems, regulatory stuff, etc. but I have always kept programming on the sidelines: HTML, PHP, CSS, REST apis, Arduino projects and so on.</p>
<p>Now I am looking to come full circle and hit programming again - probably in the mobile domain, hence learning Flutter.</p>
